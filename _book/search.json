Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers. Science, 360(6392), 987–992. doi:10.1126/science.aaq0216\nLink: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216\nThis dataset covers data from approx. 38,700 commercially viable farms in 119 countries and 40 products representing ~90% of global protein and calorie consumption.\nThe meta-analysis five important environmental impact indicators:\n\nland use\nfreshwater withdrawals weighted by local water scarcity\nGHG (greenhouse gas)\nacidifying\neutrophying emissions (runoff of excess nutrients into thesurrounding environment and waterways, which affect and polluteecosystems - measured in grams of phosphateequivalents (PO₄eq))\n\n-&gt; interesting for the Data-Storytelling: Land Use, Freshwater Use & GHG emissions\nStress-weighted WF is the volume of blue water multiplied by a water-stress index. Its main application related to water use is the potential to contribute to water scarcity and thereby limit the availability of freshwater for human uses and for the environment.\n\n\n3.1.2 Working with the data\nStarting point - overview over the overall impact of food on the climate\n“Today’s food supply chain creates ~13.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq), 26% of anthropogenic (man-made) GHG emissions.”\nPossible visualization: Pie Chart"

Maybe filter to only “plant-based”?\nInteresting metrics for the Storyline: - company focus (e.g. meat, dairy alternative) - Country/ region - year founded\nPossible insights: - growth in recent years (e.g. after 2010) - there are a lot of companys providing alternatives - maybe comparing countries? - indicating/ fitering by product type - (There are Logos in the database, could be cool to use?)"
