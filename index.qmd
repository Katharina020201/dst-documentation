# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome!

This is my project documentation for the Data Storytelling course in the winter semester of 2023/2024. </br>
In this project, I created a fictional company "Urban Butcher", collected data from public data sets and formed a "Big Idea" for an recommended action based on the data analysis. 

My Big Idea: 
_In order to remain competitive, improve its environmental footprint and promote a sustainable
image among customers, Urban Butcher should expand its product range to include plant-based alternatives._

The data visualizations which were used to communicate this Big Idea are realised with the python libraries pandas and altair, presented on quarto and streamlit.
