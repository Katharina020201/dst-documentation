# Learnings

## Coding and Coding Environment 

Prior to this course, I had very minimal coding experience. Now I have a better understanding of programming with python and setting up a coding environment and handeling it. 

I learned following tools and topics: 

- how to set up an virtual environment
- basics of (Power Shell) commands/ terminal
- python basics 
- jupyter notebook
- anaconda as a package management tool
- quarto 
- streamlit 
- the python libraries altair and pandas
- sassy css (scss)
- yml



## Data Literacy

Because my Data Literacy course from semester 1 and 2 was a while ago, I refreshed my knowledge of Data Science. 

- Qualitative vs. quantitative variables 
-
