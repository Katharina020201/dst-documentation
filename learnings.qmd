## Coding and Coding Environment 

Prior to this course, I had very minimal coding experience. Now I have a better understanding of programming with python and setting up a coding environment and handeling it. 

I learned following tools and topics: 

- how to set up an virtual environment
- basics of (Power Shell) commands/ terminal
- python basics 
- jupyter notebooks
- anaconda as a package management tool
- quarto 
- streamlit 
- the python libraries altair and pandas
- sassy css (scss)
- yml

While working with jupyter notebooks, I realized how important it is to keep a clean folder structure inside the project. 
That is why I created a cleaned data and an original data folder inside my code folder. After reading the data files into the notebooks and cleaning them, I saved them inside the cleaned data folder to avoid confusion and to run the notebooks smoothly.

## Data Literacy & Data Storytelling

Because my Data Literacy course from semester 1 and 2 was a while ago, I refreshed my knowledge on Data Science/ Statistics. 

I now know helpful websites where you can get inspiration for data visualizations, like <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/" target="_blank">From Data to Viz</a>.

The Data Storytelling Principles [@knaflic-2015]:

- understand the context/ your audience
- choose an effective visual 
- eliminate clutter
- focus attention 
- tell a story
