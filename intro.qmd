## Persona

To understand my audience - in my case the owner of urban butcher "Alex Menzinger" - I created a persona with the goals, objectives and challenges.

## Corporate Design 

For the corporate design and logo of Urban Butcher, I imaged what a modern & young, but not that high-end butchery could look like. To communicate my fictional company and use case efficienty, I choose a very literal name and logo, which conveys the subject of the company, the product, a trendy brand "urban" and the location. 

For the colors, I wanted to make sure to have a green and red tone to compare plant and animal products. To draw attention and hence implement the data storytelling principles, I also incorporated the "blue_highlight" color.
